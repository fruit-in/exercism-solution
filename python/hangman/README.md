# Hangman

Implement the logic of the hangman game using functional reactive programming.

[Hangman][] is a simple word guessing game.

[Functional Reactive Programming][frp] is a way to write interactive
programs. It differs from the usual perspective in that instead of
saying "when the button is pressed increment the counter", you write
"the value of the counter is the sum of the number of times the button
is pressed."

Implement the basic logic behind hangman using functional reactive
programming.  You'll need to install an FRP library for this, this will
be described in the language/track specific files of the exercise.

## Hints

Please ignore the part regarding FRP library, a third party library is not required for this exercise.

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to raise an exception. When you do this, you should include a meaningful error message to
indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. Not
every exercise will require you to raise an exception, but for those that do, the tests will only pass if you include
a message.

To raise a message with an exception, just write it as an argument to the exception type. For example, instead of
`raise Exception`, you should write:

```python
raise Exception("Meaningful message indicating the source of the error")
```

## Running the tests

To run the tests, run `pytest hangman_test.py`

Alternatively, you can tell Python to run the pytest module:
`python -m pytest hangman_test.py`

### Common `pytest` options

- `-v` : enable verbose output
- `-x` : stop running tests on first failure
- `--ff` : run failures from previous test before running other test cases

For other options, see `python -m pytest -h`

## Submitting Exercises

Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure the solution is in the `$EXERCISM_WORKSPACE/python/hangman` directory.

You can find your Exercism workspace by running `exercism debug` and looking for the line that starts with `Workspace`.

For more detailed information about running tests, code style and linting,
please see [Running the Tests](http://exercism.io/tracks/python/tests).

## Submitting Incomplete Solutions

It's possible to submit an incomplete solution so you can see how others have completed the exercise.
