# Darts

Write a function that returns the earned points in a single toss of a Darts game.

[Darts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darts) is a game where players
throw darts to a [target](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darts#/media/File:Darts_in_a_dartboard.jpg).

In our particular instance of the game, the target rewards with 4 different amounts of points, depending on where the dart lands:

* If the dart lands outside the target, player earns no points (0 points).
* If the dart lands in the outer circle of the target, player earns 1 point.
* If the dart lands in the middle circle of the target, player earns 5 points.
* If the dart lands in the inner circle of the target, player earns 10 points.

The outer circle has a radius of 10 units (This is equivalent to the total radius for the entire target), the middle circle a radius of 5 units, and the inner circle a radius of 1. Of course, they are all centered to the same point (That is, the circles are [concentric](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConcentricCircles.html)) defined by the coordinates (0, 0).

Write a function that given a point in the target (defined by its `real` cartesian coordinates `x` and `y`), returns the correct amount earned by a dart landing in that point.

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to raise an exception. When you do this, you should include a meaningful error message to
indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. Not
every exercise will require you to raise an exception, but for those that do, the tests will only pass if you include
a message.

To raise a message with an exception, just write it as an argument to the exception type. For example, instead of
`raise Exception`, you should write:

```python
raise Exception("Meaningful message indicating the source of the error")
```

## Running the tests

To run the tests, run `pytest darts_test.py`

Alternatively, you can tell Python to run the pytest module:
`python -m pytest darts_test.py`

### Common `pytest` options

- `-v` : enable verbose output
- `-x` : stop running tests on first failure
- `--ff` : run failures from previous test before running other test cases

For other options, see `python -m pytest -h`

## Submitting Exercises

Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure the solution is in the `$EXERCISM_WORKSPACE/python/darts` directory.

You can find your Exercism workspace by running `exercism debug` and looking for the line that starts with `Workspace`.

For more detailed information about running tests, code style and linting,
please see [Running the Tests](http://exercism.io/tracks/python/tests).
