# Luhn

Given a number determine whether or not it is valid per the Luhn formula.

The [Luhn algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm) is
a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification
numbers, such as credit card numbers and Canadian Social Insurance
Numbers.

The task is to check if a given string is valid.

Validating a Number
------

Strings of length 1 or less are not valid. Spaces are allowed in the input,
but they should be stripped before checking. All other non-digit characters
are disallowed.

## Example 1: valid credit card number

```text
4539 1488 0343 6467
```

The first step of the Luhn algorithm is to double every second digit,
starting from the right. We will be doubling

```text
4_3_ 1_8_ 0_4_ 6_6_
```

If doubling the number results in a number greater than 9 then subtract 9
from the product. The results of our doubling:

```text
8569 2478 0383 3437
```

Then sum all of the digits:

```text
8+5+6+9+2+4+7+8+0+3+8+3+3+4+3+7 = 80
```

If the sum is evenly divisible by 10, then the number is valid. This number is valid!

## Example 2: invalid credit card number

```text
8273 1232 7352 0569
```

Double the second digits, starting from the right

```text
7253 2262 5312 0539
```

Sum the digits

```text
7+2+5+3+2+2+6+2+5+3+1+2+0+5+3+9 = 57
```

57 is not evenly divisible by 10, so this number is not valid.


## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to raise an exception. When you do this, you should include a meaningful error message to
indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. Not
every exercise will require you to raise an exception, but for those that do, the tests will only pass if you include
a message.

To raise a message with an exception, just write it as an argument to the exception type. For example, instead of
`raise Exception`, you should write:

```python
raise Exception("Meaningful message indicating the source of the error")
```

## Running the tests

To run the tests, run `pytest luhn_test.py`

Alternatively, you can tell Python to run the pytest module:
`python -m pytest luhn_test.py`

### Common `pytest` options

- `-v` : enable verbose output
- `-x` : stop running tests on first failure
- `--ff` : run failures from previous test before running other test cases

For other options, see `python -m pytest -h`

## Submitting Exercises

Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure the solution is in the `$EXERCISM_WORKSPACE/python/luhn` directory.

You can find your Exercism workspace by running `exercism debug` and looking for the line that starts with `Workspace`.

For more detailed information about running tests, code style and linting,
please see [Running the Tests](http://exercism.io/tracks/python/tests).
