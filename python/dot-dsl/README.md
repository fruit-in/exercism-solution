# DOT DSL

A [Domain Specific Language
(DSL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) is a
small language optimized for a specific domain. Since a DSL is 
targeted, it can greatly impact productivity/understanding by allowing the 
writer to declare *what* they want rather than *how*.

One problem area where they are applied are complex customizations/configurations.

For example the [DOT language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)) allows
you to write a textual description of a graph which is then transformed into a picture by one of
the [Graphviz](http://graphviz.org/) tools (such as `dot`). A simple graph looks like this:

    graph {
        graph [bgcolor="yellow"]
        a [color="red"]
        b [color="blue"]
        a -- b [color="green"]
    }

Putting this in a file `example.dot` and running `dot example.dot -T png
-o example.png` creates an image `example.png` with red and blue circle
connected by a green line on a yellow background.

Write a Domain Specific Language similar to the Graphviz dot language.

Our DSL is similar to the Graphviz dot language in that our DSL will be used
to create graph data structures. However, unlike the DOT Language, our DSL will
be an internal DSL for use only in our language. 

More information about the difference between internal and external DSLs can be
found [here](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainSpecificLanguage.html).

## Description of DSL

A graph, in this DSL, is an object of type `Graph`, taking a list of one 
or more

+ attributes
+ nodes
+ edges

described as tuples.

The implementations of `Node` and `Edge` provided in `dot_dsl.py`.

Observe the test cases in `dot_dsl_test.py` to understand the DSL's design.


## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to raise an exception. When you do this, you should include a meaningful error message to
indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. Not
every exercise will require you to raise an exception, but for those that do, the tests will only pass if you include
a message.

To raise a message with an exception, just write it as an argument to the exception type. For example, instead of
`raise Exception`, you should write:

```python
raise Exception("Meaningful message indicating the source of the error")
```

## Running the tests

To run the tests, run `pytest dot_dsl_test.py`

Alternatively, you can tell Python to run the pytest module:
`python -m pytest dot_dsl_test.py`

### Common `pytest` options

- `-v` : enable verbose output
- `-x` : stop running tests on first failure
- `--ff` : run failures from previous test before running other test cases

For other options, see `python -m pytest -h`

## Submitting Exercises

Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure the solution is in the `$EXERCISM_WORKSPACE/python/dot-dsl` directory.

You can find your Exercism workspace by running `exercism debug` and looking for the line that starts with `Workspace`.

For more detailed information about running tests, code style and linting,
please see [Running the Tests](http://exercism.io/tracks/python/tests).
