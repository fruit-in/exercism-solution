# Minesweeper

Add the mine counts to a completed Minesweeper board.

Minesweeper is a popular game where the user has to find the mines using
numeric hints that indicate how many mines are directly adjacent
(horizontally, vertically, diagonally) to a square.

In this exercise you have to create some code that counts the number of
mines adjacent to a given empty square and replaces that square with the
count.

The board is a rectangle composed of blank space (' ') characters. A mine 
is represented by an asterisk ('\*') character.

If a given space has no adjacent mines at all, leave that square blank.

## Examples

For example you may receive a 5 x 4 board like this (empty spaces are
represented here with the '·' character for display on screen):

```
·*·*·
··*··
··*··
·····
```

And your code will transform it into this:

```
1*3*1
13*31
·2*2·
·111·
```

## Implementation Notes
The board function must validate its input and raise a
ValueError with a *meaningful* error message if the
input turns out to be malformed.


## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to raise an exception. When you do this, you should include a meaningful error message to
indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. Not
every exercise will require you to raise an exception, but for those that do, the tests will only pass if you include
a message.

To raise a message with an exception, just write it as an argument to the exception type. For example, instead of
`raise Exception`, you should write:

```python
raise Exception("Meaningful message indicating the source of the error")
```

## Running the tests

To run the tests, run `pytest minesweeper_test.py`

Alternatively, you can tell Python to run the pytest module:
`python -m pytest minesweeper_test.py`

### Common `pytest` options

- `-v` : enable verbose output
- `-x` : stop running tests on first failure
- `--ff` : run failures from previous test before running other test cases

For other options, see `python -m pytest -h`

## Submitting Exercises

Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure the solution is in the `$EXERCISM_WORKSPACE/python/minesweeper` directory.

You can find your Exercism workspace by running `exercism debug` and looking for the line that starts with `Workspace`.

For more detailed information about running tests, code style and linting,
please see [Running the Tests](http://exercism.io/tracks/python/tests).

## Submitting Incomplete Solutions

It's possible to submit an incomplete solution so you can see how others have completed the exercise.
