Execute (empty strand):
  let g:strand = ""
  let g:expected = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'T': 0, 'G': 0}
  AssertEqual g:expected, NucleotideCounts(g:strand)

Execute (can count one nucleotide in single-character input):
  let g:strand = "G"
  let g:expected = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'T': 0, 'G': 1}
  AssertEqual g:expected, NucleotideCounts(g:strand)

Execute (strand with repeated nucleotide):
  let g:strand = "GGGGGGG"
  let g:expected = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'T': 0, 'G': 7}
  AssertEqual g:expected, NucleotideCounts(g:strand)

Execute (strand with multiple nucleotides):
  let g:strand = "AGCTTTTCATTCTGACTGCAACGGGCAATATGTCTCTGTGTGGATTAAAAAAAGAGTGTCTGATAGCAGC"
  let g:expected = {'A': 20, 'C': 12, 'T': 21, 'G': 17}
  AssertEqual g:expected, NucleotideCounts(g:strand)

Execute (strand with invalid nucleotides):
  let g:strand = "AGXXACT"
  let g:expected = "Invalid nucleotide in strand"
  AssertThrows call NucleotideCounts(g:strand)
  AssertEqual g:expected, g:vader_exception
