# Scrabble Score

Given a word, compute the Scrabble score for that word.

## Letter Values

You'll need these:

```text
Letter                           Value
A, E, I, O, U, L, N, R, S, T       1
D, G                               2
B, C, M, P                         3
F, H, V, W, Y                      4
K                                  5
J, X                               8
Q, Z                               10
```

## Examples

"cabbage" should be scored as worth 14 points:

- 3 points for C
- 1 point for A, twice
- 3 points for B, twice
- 2 points for G
- 1 point for E

And to total:

- `3 + 2*1 + 2*3 + 2 + 1`
- = `3 + 2 + 6 + 3`
- = `5 + 9`
- = 14

## Extensions

## Elm Installation

Refer to the [Installing Elm](https://exercism.io/tracks/elm/installation) page
for information about installing elm.

## Writing the Code

The code you have to write is located inside the `src/` directory of the exercise.
Elm automatically installs packages dependencies the first time you run the tests
so we can start by running the tests from the exercise directory with:

```bash
$ elm-test
```

To automatically run tests again when you save changes:

```bash
$ elm-test --watch
```

As you work your way through the tests suite in the file `tests/Tests.elm`,
be sure to remove the `skip <|`
calls from each test until you get them all passing!
