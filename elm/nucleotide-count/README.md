# Nucleotide Count

Given a single stranded DNA string, compute how many times each nucleotide occurs in the string.

The genetic language of every living thing on the planet is DNA.
DNA is a large molecule that is built from an extremely long sequence of individual elements called nucleotides.
4 types exist in DNA and these differ only slightly and can be represented as the following symbols: 'A' for adenine, 'C' for cytosine, 'G' for guanine, and 'T' thymine.

Here is an analogy:
- twigs are to birds nests as
- nucleotides are to DNA as
- legos are to lego houses as
- words are to sentences as...

## Elm Installation

Refer to the [Installing Elm](https://exercism.io/tracks/elm/installation) page
for information about installing elm.

## Writing the Code

The code you have to write is located inside the `src/` directory of the exercise.
Elm automatically installs packages dependencies the first time you run the tests
so we can start by running the tests from the exercise directory with:

```bash
$ elm-test
```

To automatically run tests again when you save changes:

```bash
$ elm-test --watch
```

As you work your way through the tests suite in the file `tests/Tests.elm`,
be sure to remove the `skip <|`
calls from each test until you get them all passing!
