# Raindrops

Your task is to convert a number into a string that contains raindrop sounds corresponding to certain potential factors. A factor is a number that evenly divides into another number, leaving no remainder. The simplest way to test if a one number is a factor of another is to use the [modulo operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation).

The rules of `raindrops` are that if a given number:

- has 3 as a factor, add 'Pling' to the result.
- has 5 as a factor, add 'Plang' to the result.
- has 7 as a factor, add 'Plong' to the result.
- _does not_ have any of 3, 5, or 7 as a factor, the result should be the digits of the number.

## Examples

- 28 has 7 as a factor, but not 3 or 5, so the result would be "Plong".
- 30 has both 3 and 5 as factors, but not 7, so the result would be "PlingPlang".
- 34 is not factored by 3, 5, or 7, so the result would be "34".

## Elm Installation

Refer to the [Installing Elm](https://exercism.io/tracks/elm/installation) page
for information about installing elm.

## Writing the Code

The code you have to write is located inside the `src/` directory of the exercise.
Elm automatically installs packages dependencies the first time you run the tests
so we can start by running the tests from the exercise directory with:

```bash
$ elm-test
```

To automatically run tests again when you save changes:

```bash
$ elm-test --watch
```

As you work your way through the tests suite in the file `tests/Tests.elm`,
be sure to remove the `skip <|`
calls from each test until you get them all passing!

A variation on FizzBuzz, a famous technical interview question that is intended to weed out potential candidates. That question is itself derived from Fizz Buzz, a popular children's game for teaching division. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz)
