# Sublist

Given two lists determine if the first list is contained within the second
list, if the second list is contained within the first list, if both lists are
contained within each other or if none of these are true.

Specifically, a list A is a sublist of list B if by dropping 0 or more elements
from the front of B and 0 or more elements from the back of B you get a list
that's completely equal to A.

Examples:

 * A = [1, 2, 3], B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], A is a sublist of B
 * A = [3, 4, 5], B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], A is a sublist of B
 * A = [3, 4], B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], A is a sublist of B
 * A = [1, 2, 3], B = [1, 2, 3], A is equal to B
 * A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], B = [2, 3, 4], A is a superlist of B
 * A = [1, 2, 4], B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], A is not a superlist of, sublist of or equal to B

## Elm Installation

Refer to the [Installing Elm](https://exercism.io/tracks/elm/installation) page
for information about installing elm.

## Writing the Code

The code you have to write is located inside the `src/` directory of the exercise.
Elm automatically installs packages dependencies the first time you run the tests
so we can start by running the tests from the exercise directory with:

```bash
$ elm-test
```

To automatically run tests again when you save changes:

```bash
$ elm-test --watch
```

As you work your way through the tests suite in the file `tests/Tests.elm`,
be sure to remove the `skip <|`
calls from each test until you get them all passing!

## Submitting Incomplete Solutions

It is possible to submit an incomplete solution so you can see how others have
completed the exercise.
